# How to Find Places to Stay?
If you are starting out your journey as a full-time digital nomad or just considering a brief 'workation', one of the first tasks at hand is to find a place to stay. Here are some tips and tricks to go about this.

## General Property Checklist
- Ensure availability of basic amenities such as food, water, electricity, laundry, etc. Read reviews to make sure no one is complaining about these things. Food, laundry etc. maybe offered by your stay provider, or should be available nearby. Worst case, make sure you will be able to cook or do your laundry yourself.
- Ensure the stay has WiFi or get an idea of mobile network coverage there. Having Airtel+Jio dual sim should have you covered in most places in India.
- Proximity to co-working spaces / cafes to work from can be considered.
- Ensure there is a private/silent space to take calls from (if your work involves this).
- Try to look for reviews mentioning “work” or “workation” and read them.
- Try to find work desks, tables, power sockets, etc. in the property photos.
- Check with the property owner about working from there if their contact information is available.
- Always try to book a short stay to start with and extend once you are comfortable.

## The Art of Review Reading
- **Always read reviews before booking.** Do not blindly trust influencers and visual content creators. The aggregate opinion of hundreds of reviewers is always better than a paid-for review by one person. Even if you find a place through an influencer’s page/channel, read reviews on Google Maps or elsewhere before booking.
- **Read the latest reviews.** Though this may not be the default option, most platforms give you an option to read the recent reviews. With Google Maps, you can sort by "Latest First". This way you’d know how active the place is in the current season. Many places are very different depending on the season. Some places even shut shop during the off-season. Sometimes, a change in management or staff can also affect the reviews significantly.
- **Read the most negative reviews.** Again, most platforms have filter/sort for this. You’ll know what’s the worst that could happen. For example, if the only negative reviews out of hundreds of total reviews are from someone expecting car parking at backpacker’s hostel, or a despo guy complaining about lack of female solo travelers, then you know it’s a good place. But if there are multiple complaints about mosquitoes, bed bugs, other insects and reptiles, water unavailability, unattentive staff, unruly stuff, instances of theft at the property, etc., these are not to be ignored. There have been instances of properties justifying mosquito presence in the name of nature, and guests falling sick with dengue infections. These are things you would avoid at any cost, especially for long stays.
- **Look for reviews mentioning the owner.** If many reviews mention “owner” or names of the staff on a positive note, it’s always a good sign. There will be minor issues anywhere but the willingness of the management to make your stay comfortable is always a big plus.
- **Look at number of reviews, not just the avg. rating.** Number of reviews is as important as the aggregate rating. In the same location, it would be wiser to choose a 4.4-rated place with 500 reviews over a 4.9-rated place with just 10 reviews.

## Hostels
- Hostels are a good option if you are traveling solo, given most hotels, home stays and AirBNBs cater to a minimum of two people.
- Find hostels and [hostelworld.com](https://hostelworld.com), [booking.com](https://booking.com) or search for “hostels”, “backpacker hostels” etc. on Google Maps.
- At every hostel, ask other travelers where else they have traveled, how long they stayed and which hostels they would recommend in each location.
- Branded hostels like Zostel, Hosteller, GoStops can be a safe & standard experience, but a well-managed, standalone hostel run by a local can give you a lingering experience with a local touch. These are best found on Google Maps and Hostelworld.
