## How to get into Toptal

At the time of writing this post, there are 4 rounds you have to go through before you can be part of the Toptal network. 

1. **Language & Personality:** Applicants are expected to read, write, and speak English well.
2. **In-depth Skill Review:** They are tested for technical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, and intellect.
3. **Live Screening:** Applicants are screened by other freelancers on their domain expertise, experience, communication and problem-solving ability, and creativity.
4. **Test Projects:** They are also given real-world scenarios to demonstrate their competence and other skills.

1Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp; So the first round is the easiest, which is a simple phone call where they check that you can speak proper English and that you are like a good enough developer. This round is handled by a non-tech person.

2Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp; The next round is the hardest for most people because it is a competitive programming style round where you have 90 minutes to solve three coding puzzles (1st - easy, 2nd - medium, 3rd - hard). You can choose any language to solve these questions.

> **Pro tip 1:** Sign up for HackerRank (or similar platforms) to get practice and attune your muscle memory to solve exercises within time constraints.

> **Pro tip 2:** Don't cheat. They have an extensive mechanism in place to detect fraudulent activity.

3Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp; The third round is a live coding session where you get 10-15 minutes to solve a DS/Algo problem. This is also a stressful experience because the interviewer is watching you right from the camera. You're writing code in front of them, so you can't Google too much. And you can't ask for help. 

> **Pro tip 1:** Practice mock rounds with your friends to get prior experience of a stressful environment.

> **Pro tip 2:** Take a nap before the interview. So that your mind is totally empty and you go in feeling relaxed. 

4Ô∏è‚É£ &nbsp; And the fourth round is about creating a software project. So like making a front end plus back end website using React and ExpressJS and MongoDB (or any other stack that you feel comfortable with). This round is kind of simple if you have been into software development because you just have to make sure that you write clean code, handle all the edge cases, etc.

## How do you get clients in Toptal

It's a mix of push and pull strategy. You will see a feed of all available jobs which you can then apply for, and then the recruiter (*Toptal person who pays middleman between the client and you*) will reach. When you have built some reputation within Toptal, recruiters might reach out to you directly and ask you to take a look at a specific job.

## What are the tradeoffs involved?

How long do these jobs last for? Are the engagements of short-term nature or are there jobs where you end up working for more than a year with a specific client.

Frankly, it depends a lot on the company. If a company is very small, then there is a huge chance that they will have a change of priorities. But if you work with an established company, chances are that it will be a long-term engagement.

The great part about Toptal is that you do have a slew of high-quality opportunities waiting in the pipeline. So you can pick yourself up quickly.

Also, the fact that you can command higher rates helps a ton. The advice here is to save a lot of that income and keep an emergency fund for the periods when you don't have a client. 

That said, it can be frustrating to get dropped after every two (or three) months. So please do consider the tradeoffs before you jump into freelancing.
