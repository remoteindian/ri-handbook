I always have my headphones on while I am working.

And the best part is that I can switch based on my mood/work.

Here are the ones that I have curated for you.

Feel free to add to the list.


### 1/ Brain.fm

Music for the üß† as they like to call it. 

This one's paid but IMO well worth the money. There's research to back me up. Works well when I need to dive deep into a problem.

### 2/ Spotify

Now that Spotify is here in India, I am really happy that I can listen to playlists like the one below. 

Also love that I can use default music player controls on my keyboard ‚è≠
